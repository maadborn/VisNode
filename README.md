VisNode
=======

VisNode is a development tool that visualizes the connections between files (source code includes) or elements (XML data) in order to help the user understand how a set of files or data is interconnected.

--------------------------------
 Instructions
--------------------------------
Start the program by executing the RunMe.sh script. The script sets an environment variable to link to the necessary Qt libraries, found in the libs directory, and then runs the program.

Setting the files that VisNode shall parse can be done by either:
 * Starting with command line arguments: list the files separated by a space (e.g. './RunMe.sh file1.x file2.x file3.x'
 * Starting without arguments or from GUI: choose files in the dialog that pops up

--------------------------------
 File Support
--------------------------------
 * XML files
 * C/C++ source files

 License
--------------------------------
VisNode is open source and free (as in speech, beer) for everyone to use and modify.

VisNode is developed using Qt 5, upon which other licenses apply. Please take note of this if spreading or modifying this software further.
